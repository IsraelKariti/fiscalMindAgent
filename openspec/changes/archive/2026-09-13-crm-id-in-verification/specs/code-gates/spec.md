## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Checks reported by each existing gate
The gates SHALL report the following checks (keys are stable identifiers; the human labels live in the UI):

- `injection_detection_regex`: one entry per named injection pattern (`system_impersonation`, `ignore_instructions`, `ignore_instructions_he`, `system_prompt`, `system_prompt_he`, `role_tags`, `ai_address`, `ai_address_he`, `state_command`, `state_command_he`, `fence_forgery`); `passed` is `true` when the pattern did not match; a failed entry's `observed` and `note` quote the matched text (capped); a passed entry's `observed` is `null` (nothing matched).
- `validate_injection_scan`: `clean_without_evidence` when the model said "clean" (fails if it still quoted evidence); `hit_has_evidence` when the model said "suspected" (fails if it quoted nothing); `evidence_verbatim` when the model said "suspected", quoted something, and the reviewed text was readable (fails if the quote is not found verbatim in the text). When the text was not readable, `evidence_verbatim` is absent. `observed` is the model's quoted evidence (capped) or `null` when it quoted nothing.
- `validate_form_resolutions`: one entry per proposed verdict, keyed by the catalog type key; `passed` is `true` when the resolution was accepted or left for the interview as unclear, `false` when it was dropped, with the drop reason as `note`; `observed` is the proposed verdict plus, for a `not_required`, the question and quote the model cited (capped).
- `validate_classification`: `matched_id_known` when the model matched a document id (fails if that id was not in the list it was shown; `observed` = the matched id); `matched_type_agrees` when a known id was matched and the answer carries a document type (fails if the row's type disagrees; `observed` = the answer's document type, `expected` = the matched row's type); `not_injection_suspected` (fails when the model flagged a suspected injection; `observed` = the flag); `legible` (fails when the model judged the file illegible; `observed` = the model's verdict). The last two are reported even though they do not change `result` (quarantine is reported alongside, never flipped).
- `validate_message`: `json_schema` (the answer parses and matches the response schema) and `business_rules` (the parsed answer passes normalization: evidence quotes, instance caps, channel rules, attestation gate). On failure the `note` is the rejection message, capped; `business_rules` is absent when `json_schema` failed. `observed` for `json_schema` is the answer's length in characters; for `business_rules` it is the decision kind and channel the answer proposed.
- `verify_extraction`: the per-document checks, each with the value read from the document as `observed`, the reference as `expected`, and, on failure, a `note` that names the exact problem:
  - `legible`: observed = the model's legibility verdict.
  - `expected_type`: observed = what the model saw the document as (`actual_kind`); expected = the required document's name.
  - `subject`: observed = the printed subject name (or, when an id match vouched for it, the masked id); expected = the client's name.
  - `id_checksum`: observed = the masked id printed on the document.
  - `id_matches_client`: when the document prints an id and an id is on file; observed = the masked id printed on the document; expected = the masked id on file followed by its source in parentheses: the tax-portal credentials or the monday CRM card.
  - `client_id_on_file`: when the document prints an id but no id is on file (after the CRM-card fetch of the `declaration-kickoff` capability); `passed: false`, observed = "none", note = the client has no id on the tax-portal credentials or the monday CRM card, so the printed id could not be compared. This check is reported alongside and does not change `result`.
  - `as_of_date`: observed = the as-of date read (or "not stated"); expected = 31.12 of the declaration year.
  - `not_expired`: observed = the valid-until date read; expected = the verification date.
  - `amounts`: observed = the amounts found, each as label, value and currency (capped to a short list); the failure note says which condition failed: no amounts found, a negative value, a value above the sane cap, or a value that is not a number, naming the offending amount.

#### Scenario: Amounts check fails on a specific amount
- **WHEN** the extractor returns amounts "יתרת עו"ש 12,340 ILS" and "פיקדון -5 ILS"
- **THEN** the `verify_extraction` row's `amounts` entry has `passed: false`, `observed` listing both amounts, and a `note` saying the deposit amount is negative

#### Scenario: Passed check still shows what it inspected
- **WHEN** the as-of date read from the document is 2025-12-31 for declaration year 2025
- **THEN** the `as_of_date` entry has `passed: true`, `observed: "2025-12-31"`, `expected: "2025-12-31"` and `note: null`

#### Scenario: Regex gate hit
- **WHEN** an inbound message contains "ignore all previous instructions"
- **THEN** the `injection_detection_regex` row lists eleven checks, `ignore_instructions` with `passed: false` and a note quoting the matched text, the others with `passed: true`, and `result: false`

#### Scenario: Classification drops an unknown id but stays legible
- **WHEN** the classifier answers with a matched id that was not among the ids it was shown, `legible: true` and no suspected injection
- **THEN** the `validate_classification` row has `result: false`, `matched_id_known` failed with a note naming the rejected id, and `not_injection_suspected` and `legible` passed

#### Scenario: Decision rejected by business rules
- **WHEN** the planner's answer parses against the schema but normalization rejects it (for example, an evidence quote not found in the transcript)
- **THEN** the `validate_message` row for that attempt has `result: false`, `json_schema` passed and `business_rules` failed with the rejection message as note

#### Scenario: Printed id compared with the CRM card's id
- **WHEN** the client's id on file came from the monday CRM card and the document prints the same id
- **THEN** the `verify_extraction` row has `id_matches_client` passed, observed the masked printed id, expected the masked id on file with "(monday CRM)" as its source

#### Scenario: Printed id but nothing on file
- **WHEN** the document prints an id, the client has no tax-portal credentials, and the CRM card (if any) yields no id
- **THEN** the row carries `client_id_on_file` with `passed: false` and a note that no id is on file, `id_matches_client` is absent, and `result` is not affected by this check
